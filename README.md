        'marking_markables' => 'marking_markables',
    ],
];
```

## Usage

### Add trait to your Models

Your models should use the Markable trait:

```php
use TLabsCo\LaravelMarking\Models;

class MyModel extends Eloquent
{
    use Markable;
}
```

### Adding and Removing Mark from a Model

Mark your models with the `marking()` method:

```php
// Pass in a delimited string:
$model->marking('Coffee,Cake,Fruit');

// Or an array:
$model->marking(['Coffee', 'Cake', 'Fruit']);
```

You can remove marks individually with `unmarking()` or entirely with `demarking()`:

```php
$model->marking('Coffee,Cake,Fruit');

$model->unmarking('Fruit');
// $model is now just marked with "Coffee" and "Cake"

$model->demarking();
// $model has no marks anymore
```

### Apply classification your marks

Config your classification from config file `marking.php`

```php
  'classifications' => ['general', 'drink', 'food']
```

Mark your models with your desired classification

```php
// Pass in a delimited string:
$model->marking('Cake,Fruit', classification: 'food');

// Or an array:
$model->marking(['Coffee'], classification: 'drink');
```

### Save the value to your marks

Config your value caster depend by classification from config file `marking.php`

```php
  'values_caster' => [
      'food' => 'intval', //
  ],
```

Mark your models with your desired value

```php
// Pass in a delimited string:
$model->marking('Fruit', ['value' => 2], classification: 'food');

// Or an array:
$model->marking([['name' => 'Coffee', 'value' => 2]], classification: 'drink');

// Or an array:
$model->marking(['Coffee' =>  ['value' => 2]], classification: 'drink');
```
